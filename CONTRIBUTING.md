# Contribute to the lists
Hi and welcome!
This guide details how to contribute to this repository.


## Contributor license agreement
By submitting code you agree to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/360AgileWeb/TeachKidzCodingTools/blob/master/LICENSE) of this repository.


## All the steps you need
1. First of all, what you want to add should be actually 'Free'. 
2. If you don't know how to work with git or github, just simply go to [Wiki: Contribution](https://github.com/360AgileWeb/TeachKidzCodingTools/wiki/Contribution) and read the rest.
3. We prefer small commits rather than one large commit in a pull request. If you don't have the time to make small commit, add an issue with all the links included and we'll add them for you.
4. Use our standard for formatting the .md file. Check it out: [Formatting](#formatting)
5. Please try to use alphabetic order.


### Formatting
+ All lists are `.md` files. Try to learn Github's Markdown syntax. It's simple!
+ All the lists start with an Index, the idea is to show all of sections and subsections there, so it's important to have an index for each section. Right now it's alphabetized, so please use alphabetic order.
+ Sections are using level 3 heading (in HTML is `<h3>`, in Markdown is `###`), and subsections are using level 4 (in HTML is `<h4>`, in Markdown is `####`).

The idea is to have
+ `2` empty lines between last suggested book & new header
+ `1` empty line between header & first book of that very section.
+ `0` empty line between each book in 1 section.
+ `1` empty line at the end of each `.md` file.

Like this example:
```markdown
[...]
* [Hour of Code ](http://www.hourofcode.com/)


### Sample
BAD : * [Hour of Code ] (http://www.hourofcode.com/)
GOOD: * [Hour of Code ](http://www.hourofcode.com/)

```


And that's it! Simple, easy and lovely...

We hope you contribute to this great repository. :+1:
